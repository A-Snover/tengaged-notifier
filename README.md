# tengaged-notifier
Notifies a user when an event occurs in their Tengaged game, i.e. when a key or apple spawns in a Castings style game.

Tengaged is a website where users play online reality games based off of popular reality TV shows such as Big Brother and Survivor.
In some modes, it is very advantageous to know when certain events occur, such as when items called Keys and Apples spawn in a mode called Casting.
These items only grant a bonus to the first person in the game that clicks on them, and they spawn randomly through the week-long game. 
So, this browser extension seeks to help users be the first to get the item without constant paranoid checking of their casting game.

Currently, this extension uses a JavaScript alert to force user attention to a tab. This is not the best practice and can prove to be annoying for many users. I am working on adding web push notifications to make the application less intrusive to use.
